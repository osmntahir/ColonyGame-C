## Project Description
I designed a simulation in C language using object-oriented programming to achieve high readability, modularity, and realism.

## Usage
You can compile the program using the Mingw compiler with the help of the makefile. Alternatively, you can directly run the "Program.exe" file inside the "bin" folder to test the program.
